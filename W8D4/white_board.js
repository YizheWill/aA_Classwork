// Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.
// An input string is valid if:
// Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
// Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
// Note that an empty string is also considered valid.
// Example 1:
// Input: "()"
// Output: true
// Example 2:
// Input: "()[]{}"
// Output: true
// Example 3:
// Input: "(]"
// Output: false
// Example 4:
// Input: "([)]"
// Output: false
// Example 5:
// Input: "{[]}"
// Output: true

// You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.
// Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.
// You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which will return whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.
// Example:
// Given n = 5, and version = 4 is the first bad version.
// call isBadVersion(3) -> false
// call isBadVersion(5) -> true
// call isBadVersion(4) -> true
// Then 4 is the first bad version.
